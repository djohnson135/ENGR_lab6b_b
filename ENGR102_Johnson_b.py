#Averaging measurements:
#Assume that someone has collected a set of measurements and wants some statistical data
#about them. Write a program that asks a user for measurements and prints the average, the
#maximum, and the minimum measurement. Users should be allowed to enter as many
#measurements as they want, until entering a negative measurement. The negative
#measurement should not be processed, but is just used to indicate that the user has finished
#entering measurements. [Note: do not use a list to store the measurements.]

# input for measurements
# variables to find average
meas = 0
total_num = 0
num = 0

# input for measurements
# input as a while loop
while meas >= 0:
    meas = float(input('What is your measurement? = ')



# if statements to find max and min

#print statement
